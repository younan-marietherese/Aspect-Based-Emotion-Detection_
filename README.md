# Aspect-Based Emotion Detection in Product Reviews

This project involves **Aspect-Based Emotion Detection**, which is a specialized task within sentiment analysis. The objective is to detect specific emotions such as anger, joy, and sadness related to a particular aspect of a product (e.g., battery life, size, color) from product reviews.

## Project Overview
Aspect-based emotion detection is crucial for understanding how customers feel about particular aspects of a product, providing valuable insights for product improvement. In this project, we focus on identifying emotions in product reviews, particularly for one specific aspect, using methods such as regular expressions, tokenization, and pre-trained word embeddings or emotion lexicons.

---

## Objectives
- Collect product reviews related to a specific aspect (e.g., battery life, color).
- Preprocess the reviews by extracting sentences related to the chosen aspect.
- Detect emotions such as anger, joy, and sadness for each sentence using lexicons or word embeddings.
- Evaluate the accuracy of emotion detection using manual validation and evaluation metrics.
- Provide recommendations based on the emotions detected.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the emotion detection workflow.
- **Pandas**: For managing the dataset of product reviews.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: For extracting aspect-specific sentences.
- **NLTK/SpaCy**: For tokenization and text processing.
- **Pre-trained Word Embeddings**: For emotion detection.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing results.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 50 product reviews related to a specific aspect of a product. These reviews may be written in Arabic, or English reviews can be translated to Arabic. Reviews can also be generated using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to augment the dataset.

Each review is processed to extract sentences related to the selected aspect of the product, such as the battery life of a phone or the fabric quality of a dress.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect or generate 50 product reviews (in Arabic or translated from English).
   - Identify the aspect of interest (e.g., size, color, battery life).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Use regular expressions or tokenization to extract sentences related to the selected aspect from the product reviews.

3. **Emotion Detection**:
   - Use an existing emotion lexicon or pre-trained word embeddings to detect emotions like anger, joy, and sadness in the aspect-specific sentences.
   - Optionally, build your own lexicon for the selected emotions.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Validate the emotion detection results manually or use evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

5. **Recommendation**:
   - Based on the emotions detected, provide a recommendation about how customers feel about the specific aspect. For example, do customers experience frustration with battery life, or are they satisfied with the productâ€™s color?
